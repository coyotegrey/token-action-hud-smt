# Token Action HUD Shin Megami Tensei

A module for using Token Action HUD with the Shin Megami Tensei TRPG Devil City Tokyo 200X system.

## Features

- Make rolls directly from the HUD instead of opening your character sheet.
- Display the details for stats, features, and gear in chat.
- Toggle statuses on and off.
- Equip or unequip gear.
- Move the HUD and choose to expand the menus up or down.
- Unlock the HUD to customize layout and groups per user, and actions per actor.
- Add your own macros, journal entries and roll table compendiums.

## Required Modules

**IMPORTANT** â€” Token Action HUD Shin Megami Tensei requires the [Token Action HUD Core](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud-core) and [Shin Megami Tensei](https://github.com/Alondaar/smt-200x) modules to be installed.

**Required versions:**
- TAH SMT v0.0.1 and newer: Core v2.0, SMT-200X v0.884

## Recommended Modules

* Token Action HUD uses the [Color Picker](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/color-picker) library module for its color picker settings.

#### Does Right Click do anything?
Yes, Right Click does one thing currently, depending on what you are clicking:
* Stats - launches full dialog when rolling.
* Features - target numbers and power rolls launch full dialog when rolling. Uses decrement on right click.
* Consumables - decrement uses on right click.

Otherwise, Right Click behaves just like Left Click.
